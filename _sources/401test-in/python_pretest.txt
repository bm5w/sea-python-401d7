============================
Test-in For Code 401: Python
============================

Guidelines
==========

**Create a Python module** that generates a K-12 school with students and teachers at every grade level. Make sure to appropriately document your code. Show us what you can do!

Data Representation
-------------------

1. Your school should have a name, and can have many students and many teachers.
2. Students should have names, GPAs (out of 100), grade level (K - 12), and a teacher name.
3. Teachers should have names and grade levels, and should be able to have multiple students.
4. A teacher should have no more than 10 students.
5. If there are no teachers, there should be no students.


Submitting Your Work
====================

* You will create a public GitHub repository for your work and email in the link to that repository.
* In the README of that repository, you'll include a description of the module that you built and links to any code that you may have used. In that description, you'll include explanations of any functions/objects/methods you write.
* Use a good Git workflow, with branches for new features and work only being merged to `master`, not done directly on `master`. Write meaningful commit messages as well. No one wants to end up on http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/
