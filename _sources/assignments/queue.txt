    This document contains no slides.

Begin by reading about the `Queue data structure`_.

.. _Queue data structure: http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Queue_(data_structure).html

Tasks
=====

Create a new branch in your data structures repository called ``queue``.
On this new branch, create a file called ``que_.py``.
**IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU NAME IT THIS WAY, AND NOT queue.py!**
If you name it ``queue.py``, you're gonna have a bad time.

On that branch, write tests for and then implement a ``Queue`` with the following features:

* **enqueue(value)**: adds value to the queue
* **dequeue()**: removes the correct item from the queue and returns its value
  (should raise an error if the queue is empty)
* **peek()**: returns the next value in the queue without dequeueing it. If the
  queue is empty, returns None
* **size()**: return the size of the queue.  Should return 0 if the queue is
  empty.

As with the linked list and stack assignments before this, you may not use any
existing Python implementation to create your queue.
You must also enable this structure to interact with the built-in ``len()``.

You should update the repository ``README.md`` with information about the Queue you implemented, including any resources or collaborations you used.
**It is a requirement that for each method of this data structure, you include in the README a description of its time complexity in Big-O notation! Expect to lose credit if you don't have this.**


Submitting Your Work
====================


When your tasks are complete and all tests are passing, submit a pull request
from your queue branch back to ``master``.  Copy the URL for that pull request and
submit it.  After you submit your assignment, you may merge your queue branch
back to ``master``.

Use the comment feature in Canvas to submit questions, comments and
reflections.
