You will want to be able to create and use domain names for the apps you create
in class.  Moreover, it can be handy to have your own domain name for things
like email and a personal website.

I you do not already have one, get an account with a DNS provider.  Choose one
that can provide email services for you so that you can associate email
addresses with the domains you create.

Unless you already have an account with them **DO NOT USE GoDaddy**.

To submit this assignment, please enter the domain name you have chosen.

If going to that domain name does not work, please submit a screenshot of your
DNS registry page, showing the name you own.
