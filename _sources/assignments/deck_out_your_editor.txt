Deck Out Your Editor
********************

As a developer, your text editor is your primary tool.
It is well worth your while to take the time to make it your friend.

Tasks
=====

Read :doc:`the assignment text </readings/sublime_as_ide>` to get some ideas about how you can improve your text editor.
If you are not a Sublime Text user, consider it a challenge to learn how to make similar improvements to your editor of choice.

Complete the enhancements listed by the deadline.

In addition, see if you can find a few other add-ons that you find useful.
Try to install them and configure them.

Searching online for "editor enhancements for python development" can be of help in brainstorming.

Finally, and this is entirely optional but definitely recommended so that you don't have to deal with VIM, **set your editor as the main editor for Git.**
Assuming you can use the ``subl`` command to open up Sublime Text, set your editor with the following line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git config --global core.editor "subl -n -w"

If you don't have the command, find the location of Sublime and use the path to
the Sublime app in place of ``subl`` above.
If you use something instead of Sublime, use that instead.
Keep ``-n`` so that a new window is opened when Git pops open your editor.
Keep ``-w`` if you want the command line to wait for when you save whatever action Git wants you to take in that editor.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Submit screenshots of your editor showing the enhancements you've made.
In particular, style linting is crucial.

Use the comments feature to add questions, comments, and reflections on what you learned.
Especially if you find any nifty plugins or enhancements you want to share with the class.
