Group Project: Pick an Idea

    This document contains no slides.

Previously, you held a pitch session to generate ideas for group projects.
Today, you will have had a session in class where your group told me of the ideas on the table, and we had a short discussion of the feasability.
Now it's up to you.

Tasks
=====

Out of the ideas that your group brainstormed, as a group pick one (AND ONLY ONE) idea.
Give that project a descriptive, snazzy name.
For example, if your project maps Seattle's crime data, instead of naming it "Seattle Crime Map", maybe a name like "CrookWatch" might be better.

After you've written out the name, write out a short summary of your project.
No need for more than a couple paragraphs.
Try to hit the high points without diving too deeply into the implementation details.
Focus on the user interaction.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Use the provided text area to write down the names of all the members of your team.
Additionally, provide the name and summary of your selected idea.

Only one person from the group needs to submit this assignment for all to get credit.
