Django Imager: S3 Storage for Static and Media Files
****************************************************

In this series of assignments you will build a simple image management website using Django.
In this eighth step, you will modify your file storage to use the AWS S3 service instead of the file system of your EC2 instance.

Tasks
=====

Do your work for this assignment on a branch called ``aws_s3``.
Be sure that the branch contains your work for all previous parts of this work.

- Create an AWS S3 bucket for your Django Imager
- Modify your ``settings.py`` file to use the `django-storages <http://django-storages.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/amazon-S3.html>`_ package.
- Redeploy your site using S3 for storage, ensuring that content old and new all end up in the S3 bucket.

Submitting Your Work
--------------------

When you are done working and all your tests are passing, create a Pull Request from the ``aws_s3`` branch to ``master``.
Submit the URL for that pull request.
When you are done, you can merge the pull request in preparation for the next stage of your work.
