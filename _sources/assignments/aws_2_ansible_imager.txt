Repeat the deployment of your Django Imager website using the Ansible Configuration Management System.

Tasks
=====

.. Begin by forking my `sample Ansible repository <https://github.com/cewing/codefellows-ansible-example>`_ into your own github account.
.. Then clone the repository to your local machine, and make the required extensions and adjustments to deploy your own imager project.
.. You'll need to pip install both Ansible and Boto into your system Python in order for this to work properly.

You'll need to pip install Ansible into your system Python in order for this to work properly.
Unfortunately, Ansible just does not play nicely with Virtualenv.

.. Along the way, you'll need to use the ansible-galaxy command to install the `jdauphant.nginx role <https://galaxy.ansible.com/jdauphant/nginx/>`_ from the `Ansible Galaxy roles collection <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_.

You will want to spend a fair amount of time looking over the `Ansible documentation <http://docs.ansible.com/>`_, which is pretty well organized.

Remember, the basic form of the command to run an ansible playbook is:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <ansible_repo>
    $ ansible-playbook -i <path to hosts file> <path to playbook>.yml

.. $ ansible-playbook -i plugins/inventory/ <name_of_playbook>.yml

* A Screenshot of the final screen of your terminal session where the ansible playbook was run.
  This should show the steps run, which were OK, which were changed, etc.
  (You should be able to embed this screenshot in the text entry box using the little broccoli button in the editor bar.)

Part of our evaluation of this submission will be our ability to sign up for the service, add and edit photos and albums, and use the API to get to our photos.
