Job Market Research
*******************

The job hunt is approaching quickly and it helps to have a heading on what to look for, wherever you're looking for it.
Spend some time this weekend doing research.

Tasks
=====

- **Find five (5) companies** in a city where you want to work (whether it's Seattle or elsewhere) that interest you for some reason and either are hiring or have hired developers that can write Python.
- For each company answer the following:
    - What is it that they do?
    - Why does this company interest you?
    - How large is the company (if that info is available)
    - Why are they hiring developers that can write Python?

Submission
==========

Compile your answers to these questions and submit them as a text submission to Canvas.
Each question should need no more than 5 sentences to answer, but if you really must be verbose don't go over 10.
I'm not trying to read an essay.
