*********************************************
Mashup Part 1: Scraping Data from King County
*********************************************

.. slide:: Learning Journal, Final Submission
    :level: 1

    This document contains no slides.

In this assignment, you'll build a *mashup* combining data from one site with
data from another, and formatting from yet another to extract *meaning* from
*information*.

Tasks
=====

Follow along with :doc:`this tutorial <tutorials/scraper>` to build a script
that scrapes restaurant health inspection data from the King County government
website.

Note that although solutions for all the code you must write are present in the
document, they are hidden by default.  Try your hand at writing the functions
yourself first, and only click on "Peek at a solution" if you are stumped as to
how to proceed.

When the script is run from the command line, it should print out the list of
results in a readable format.

Submitting Your Assignment
==========================

To submit this assignment, create a github repository called basic-scraper.
Once the basic repository is set up with README and license, make a branch
called `step1` and add your scraper script to it. Edit the README to contain a
description of the work you've done and lists any collaborators you used.

When your work is complete, submit a pull request and copy and submit the URL
for that request.  Once that is done, you may merge your branch back to master
to prepare for tomorrow's enhancements.
