***********
Day of Code
***********

A programming language is simply syntactical sugar that describes logical processes.
The best way to learn how to use that syntactical sugar is to practice implementing your logic and strategy while speaking that language.
As such, I want you to spend every day writing a boatload of code.
Here's an assignment to help facilitate that.

If you don't already have one, create an account on `Code Wars <https://www.codewars.com>`_.
Set your language of choice to "Python".

Task
====

Code Wars is a website that allows you to take on a number of user-supplied code challenges in one of a host of languages.
The difficulty level for a given code challenge is set by the "kyu".
8th kyu is the simplest level, testing more of the basic understanding of the language.
7th kyu is more complex and requires a slightly deeper understanding of language fundamentals.
6th kyu increases the complexity in thought and application, etc.
**Every step down in kyu represents a substantially significant increase in difficulty.**

Your goal is to complete, on your own, 20 credits-worth of code challenges **BY MIDNIGHT**.
Here's what this means in terms of what you'll be attacking.
Each...

- 8th kyu: 1 credit
- 7th kyu: 2 credits
- 6th kyu: 4 credits
- 5th kyu: 5 credits
- 4th kyu: 6 credits
- 3rd kyu: 8 credits
- 2nd kyu: 9 credits
- 1st kyu: 10 credits

For reference, my profile is at the 5th kyu, and the person holding Position 1 in the Code Fellows clan is at the 3rd kyu.
The steps up in difficulty are, again, *significant*.

**You will need to budget your time well.**
If you wish to challenge yourself, step up in level.
Otherwise, stay at the level you're comfortable and simply complete the challenges.

If you don't yet have one, create a repository called ``code-katas`` and push its ``master`` branch to GitHub before doing anything further.
Then, checkout a branch named ``day-of-code``.

For every code challenge you complete, create a new Python module using the name of the challenge.
At the top of the file, above all of your code, write a doc string that includes the "Best Practices" #1 solution.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    """Kata: Opposite Number - Return the opposite of the input number.

    #1 Best Practices Solution by CrazyMerlyn & others

    def opposite(number):
        return -number
    """

Create an accompanying test file for that module.
Within, re-write the tests that are given to you by Code Wars using Pytest.
Add another 4 tests of your own to those, and ensure that they all pass in Python 2 and 3.

Finally, create a ``README.md`` for this repository, listing out the title and URL of every kata you complete, as well as the module name and test file for each.
Something like...

.. code-block:: markdown

    # Completed Katas

    **Opposite Number (8th kyu)**

    - **Module**: `opposite_number.py`
    - **Tests**: `test_opposite_number.py`
    - **URL**: [challenge url](https://www.codewars.com/kata/opposite-number)

    **Invert Values (8th kyu)**
    ...


Submitting Your Work
====================

When you're done, create a pull request from ``day-of-code`` to ``master``.
Submit the link to your pull request to Canvas.

Again, this must be submitted **BY MIDNIGHT**!
There will be **NO RESUBMITS AFTER MIDNIGHT** and **NO CREDIT GIVEN** for assignments submitted after the deadline.
Do **NOT** make the mistake of running this up until the very last minute.

Use the comment box in Canvas to talk about your thought process, as well as any difficulty you had with these katas.

Good luck!
