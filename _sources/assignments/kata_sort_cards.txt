Stretch Goal
------------

Write a script using your :doc:`Priority Queue </assignments/priority_queue>` to
sort a deck of cards.
If needed, modify your Priority Queue to fit the needs of this assignment.
Feel free to test your code with the same tests performed by Code Wars.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Create a ``sort-cards`` branch in your ``code-katas`` repository.
When your solution passes the tests at Code Wars, copy your code into a script
on the ``sort-cards`` branch.

**IF YOU COMPLETE THE STRETCH GOAL** add to your solution file the second solution
using the Priority Queue.

Add documentation about your code in the repo's ``README.md``.
Finally, copy the tests administered by Code Wars into a ``test_sort_cards.py`` file.

After you've copied your code solution over into GitHub, send a pull request
to your master branch.
**Submit the URL of that pull request to Canvas.**

Use the comment box in Canvas to talk about your thought process, as well as any difficulty you had with this code kata.
