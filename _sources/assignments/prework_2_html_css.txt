    This document contains no slides.

During the 401 Python course, we will be learning a great deal of Python.
But we will also be making use of technologies related to web development that are not Python.
A solid working knowledge of HTML and CSS is important for any web developer.

Tasks
=====

Spend the time between now and the start of class sharpening your HTML and CSS skills.

If you are a complete beginner, then may I suggest and account with either `Treehouse <http://teamtreehouse.com>`_ or `CodeAcademy <http://codeacademy.com>`_.
Once you are signed up, either site has a number of quality tutorials that cover HTML and CSS.
Pick one, and work through it.  Then pick the next in line and keep going.
Spend at least an hour a day working on this.
