.. slide:: Update Your Canvas Profile
    :level: 1

    This document contains no slides.

Please update your `profile settings`_ in Canvas. Most importantly:

* Ensure you have the proper timezone set (Yes, we are in Pacific Time, and it
  defaults to Mountain).

* Use a real picture of your happy face as a profile picture so we can get to
  know each other a little faster. Click the profile image on that `settings`_
  page to change the image.

When you are done, submit this assignment with the text "I am finished" in the
provided text box so I know you're ready for me to give you points.
