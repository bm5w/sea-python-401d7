.. slide:: Technical Blog Post: Draft Your Post
    :level: 1

    This document contains no slides.

In this series of assignments, you will be writing a blog post to share something you have learned with those who may be interested in following a similar path.

You began by generating some ideas.
Then you picked an idea and generated an outline.
Now you will write a rough draft from that outline.

Tasks
=====

Flesh out your outline into a complete blog post, incorporating the peer-review feedback.

Your post should have clear sections with titles.
You should have clear introductory and concluding paragraphs (with awesome content in between, naturally).
You should include at least two images, graphs, code samples or other visual information.
Avoid creating "wall of text" posts.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Submit a url to your draft post (gist.github.com? a parallel tumblr or wordpress.com account to use as staging?, a doc in google drive?), or legible screenshots.

This will also be reviewed by a classmate. When reviewing, give feedback on fluidity, clarity, and effectiveness of communicating the chosen concept.
