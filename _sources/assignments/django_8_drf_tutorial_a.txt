Django Rest Framework provides a full-featured framework for creating RESTful APIs based on the Django models you create.
These APIs can then be used to power applications written for mobile devices, Javascript apps in Angular or other MVC frameworks, or even "normal" web apps, replacing the more traditional "view"-based approach to CRUD operations.

To familiarize yourself with the concept, you'll walk through `this tutorial <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/#tutorial>`_ provided as part of the framework documentation.

Tasks
=====

For this first assignment, please complete the first three sections of the tutorial:

* `Serialization <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/>`_
* `Requests and Responses <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/2-requests-and-responses/>`_
* `Class-Based Views <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/3-class-based-views/>`_

Submitting Your Work
====================

For your submission, please paste screenshots of both the JSON and HTML output of a variety of endpoints from your new api.

Use the comment feature in Canvas to submit questions, considerations or comments

Further Considerations
======================

How might using a technology like this change your approach to the UI implementation of the Imager app?
What aspects of the actions provided by Imager would be most easily replaced with API calls?
Which would be more difficult to replace?
How might your approach to the UI for Imager change based on using an API like this?
