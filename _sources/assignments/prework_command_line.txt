Prework - The Command Line
============================================

Tasks
=====

Although this course is primarily focused on Python, because the work being done is on the server-side you must know how to interact with your computer. Enter: the Command Line. The assignment in this Pre-work will introduce you to some of the more common commands involved in traversing directories and manipulating files on your computer.

CodeCademy
----------

To get you going down this path, you will go through the tutorial at `CodeCademy <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>`_ and complete all four units.

If you encounter a bug where you're typing in the right commands but the interpreter doesn't move you forward, close your current shell where it says "bash" at the top and start a new one. If that doesn't work, navigate back to the front page here: `CodeCademy <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line>`_ and re-enter that lesson.
