It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project.
The next step for group projects is to complete your `wireframes`_ and storyboards.

Tasks
=====

Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website without committing any code.
You can use an online or desktop tool, such as `Moqups.com <https://moqups.com>`_ or `Mockingbird <https://gomockingbird.com/home>`_.
Or you can use paper and pen.

Storyboards combine individual wireframes into diagrams of the flow of a user through your website.
As your wireframes become more complete, consider combining them into story boards that show the various ways in which a user might interact with your site.
These will help to inform your creation of User Stories as preparations for project week continue.

Submitting Your Work
====================

If you have created wireframes online, please submit a link to them.

If you have created pen-and-paper wireframes, take a quick picture of them and upload that.

Each team member must provide this submission.
