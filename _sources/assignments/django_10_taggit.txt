    This document contains no slides.

We've seen how tags can be used to categorize models on the back-end and the front.
It's time for you to implement them yourself.

For your next assignment for the Imager app, you'll be adding tags to your images. 

Tasks
=====

* Install `Django Taggit <https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ into your virtualenv.
* Make sure to update your requirements.txt file.
* Make sure to also update your installed apps and migrations.
* Add tags to your photo models that fulfill these user stories:
    - As a user, I want to add tags to newly-uploaded images.
    - As a user, I want to add tags to existing photos.
    - As a user, I want to be able to see the tags that I've given photos when I go to the page associated with that photo.
    - As a user, I want to be able to see the tags of my photos on the library page.
    - As a user, I want to be able to click on a tag and get a list view of every photo that shares that tag.
    - As a user, when I'm on the page of an individual photo, I want to be able to see access at most 5 other photos that share the same tag(s) as the current photo.
    - As a user, when I click on an album I should be able to see all of the tags associated with all of the photos in that album.

Add tests that show your tagging system works the way that it should.


Submitting Your Work
====================

When you are finished with your implementation and all tests are passing, create a Pull request from your ``taggit`` branch to ``master``. 
Copy the URL of the new pull request. 
Submit that URL using the URL input. 
After you have completed this task, you may merge your branch back to ``master``.

As usual, use the comment feature to submit questions, comments and reflections on the work you did for this assignment.
