    This document contains no slides.

During the 401 Python course, we will be learning a great deal of Python.
But we will also be making use of technologies related to web development that are not Python.
To work in web development, you'll need to have a solid understanding of JavaScript and how it works in the client.

Tasks
=====

Spend the time between now and the start of class sharpening your JavaScript skills.

If you are a complete beginner, then may I suggest an account with either `Treehouse <http://teamtreehouse.com>`_ or `CodeAcademy <http://codeacademy.com>`_.
Once you are signed up, either site has a number of quality tutorials that cover JavaScript.
Pick one, and work through it.  Then pick the next in line and keep going.
Spend at least an hour a day working on this.
