    This document contains no slides.

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project.
The next step for group projects is to begin to generate user stories.

Tasks
=====

Create user stories that cover the functionality of your website.
Your user stories should be in the form of simple sentences in the form "As a <user category> I want to <action> so that I can <business purpose>".
Including all three details in each user story help to clarify for whom the story is written, and the specific business purpose the functionality is intended to address.
Do not forget developer-facing user stories like "as a developer I want to have one-command app deployment so I can re-deploy to production at will".

If you have chosen to use an Agile tool like `trello <https://trello.com>`_ or `scrumdo <https://www.scrumdo.com>`_, write the stories there.
It is equally valid to use github issues or milestones, or even a google doc, a paper notebook, or sticky notes.
In general, tangling with complex management tools is a bit of overkill for a week-long project like this, so keep it simple.
