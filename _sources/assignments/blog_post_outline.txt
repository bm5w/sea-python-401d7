.. slide:: Technical Blog Post: Outline a Post
    :level: 1

    This document contains no slides.

In this series of assignments, you will be writing a blog post to share
something you have learned with those who may be interested in following a
similar path.

You began by generating some ideas.  Now you'll pick and idea and generate an
outline.

Tasks
=====

Pick a topic from the list you generated (or from a topic we've discussed in
class). The topic **must** be related to Python.  Think about how you might
want to explain what you learned to someone with a similar level of experience
to you at the beginning of your time at Code Fellows.

Outline your post with as much detail as you can. Use a outlining tool like
Workflowy.com, or a mind-mapping program (like Maptini.com or Mind Node),
or just write it up in a private file at gist.github.com or a document in
google drive.

Submitting Your Work
====================

Please submit your text outline.  Either submit the text itself, a link to
where it can be viewed, or a **readable** screenshot.

Your outline will be reviewed by a peer.

As a reviewer, please give detailed feedback on how clearly the outline
progresses through concepts and targets the learning audience.
