    This document contains no slides.

You've been writing your nightly journal entries in a group journal.
It's time you had one of your own.

Tasks
=====

Begin your work by creating a new ``step2`` branch in which to do today's work.

With your partner, create and configure the following views for your learning journal:

* The ``list`` view will display a list of all the entries in your learning journal, ordered so that the most recent is first.
  It should show only the titles and creation dates for each entry.
  This view should be the home page for your journal.
* The ``detail`` view will display a single entry.

The titles for each entry on the list must be a link.
When clicked, the link should take the viewer to the detail view for that entry.

Ensure that there is a "home" button visible on both pages that returns the viewer to the home page.

Your views should be tested.
Write both *unit* tests of the view functions themselves, and *functional* tests that show the configured system works properly.

You are working with a partner to complete this application.

Submitting Your Work
====================

When your work is done and all your tests are passing, push all your work to GitHub.
Open a new pull request from the ``step2`` branch to master.
Submit the URL of that pull request to Canvas.

Finally, merge your pull request to prepare for the work in :doc:`/assignments/learning_journal_3`.

Use the comment feature in canvas to submit the following:

* At least one well-formed question about the work you did for this assignment
* At least one comment on what went well
* At least one comment on what was particularly difficult or challenging
