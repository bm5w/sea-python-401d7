.. slide:: Mashup Part 2: Extending Your Mashup With Geolocation
    :level: 1

    This document contains no slides.

In this assignment, you'll build a *mashup* combining data from one site with
data from another, and formatting from yet another to extract *meaning* from
*information*.

Tasks
=====

After learning a bit about RESTful web services, extend your restaurant health
inspection data scraper by mashing the listings up with some geocoded address
data from Google.

Start by making a new branch in your basic_scraper repository, "step2".

Follow :doc:`this tutorial <tutorials/rest>` to accomplish the task.

Note that there are stretch goals at the end of the tutorial.  Try to
accomplish as many of them as you can in a reasonable amount of time.  There is
no ordering implied by the way they are listed.  Pick ones that interest you.
Or better yet, make up your own ways to improve the script.

If you use any other references or collaborations, make note of them in your
README.

Submitting Your Work
====================

When you are done make a pull request back to master.  Copy the URL for the
pull request and submit it. Once that is done, you can go ahead and merge your
branch back to master.

As usual, use the comment feature to submit questions, comments and reflections
on what you learned.
