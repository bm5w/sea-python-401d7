Tasks
=====

Go to `www.heroku.com`_ and sign up for an account (if you already have an
account that's great, no need to make another one).

.. _www.heroku.com: http://www.heroku.com

After you've created your account, follow the Getting Started with Python on
Heroku (Links to an external site.) tutorial to install the command-line tools
you'll need and set them up.

DO NOT follow through with step 3 of the tutorial, "Prepare the app".  You will
do that tomorrow.

You will need this for your assignment Monday, so ensure that you complete
this assignment on time.

Submitting Your Assignment
==========================

Take a screenshot of your heroku account homepage (the apps tab) and upload it.

Use the comment feature in canvas to submit any questions, reflections, or
sources and collaborations you used to complete the assignment.
