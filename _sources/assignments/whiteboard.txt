********************************
Sign Up for the Whiteboard Final
********************************

Throughout this course we've done several challenges where you have been given a problem and told to solve it with a team on a whiteboard.
You would not have access to your computer, you'd only have your partners, your markers, and the whiteboard in front of you.
We do this so that you're prepared for meeting similar challenges in the job market.
Now, it's time to face the whiteboard under interview conditions.

Here is a `sign-up sheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12qKek7MOCzdObWlOnze58kAi1dBrUj6hz_KdnwS6c8w/edit?usp=sharing>`_ for the latter half of this week.
Sign up for one block only.
You will be given a whiteboard question with one of the instructional staff, with 45 minutes to solve it.
You will be given feedback as is appropriate, and will be given 3 chances to succeed.
If you do not pass the first time, sign up for another block.

You won't be asked about anything we didn't cover, but the idea is for you to use what you've learned and make connections between concepts.
We're testing how you think and approach questions you haven't seen before.
We know you can do it!
