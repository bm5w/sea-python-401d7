Django: Add Social Authentication
*********************************

Registering and logging-in with a username and password is great for most use cases.
However, it'd be even better if we could bypass that registration process altogether and use a service that already authenticates users.
Let's implement some social authentication.

**NOTE: THERE ARE NOT NOR WILL THERE BE LECTURE NOTES FOR THIS. YOU ARE DEVELOPERS NOW. EXECUTE USING DOCUMENTATION**.
Good places to start: `here <https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django>`_ and `also here <http://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Tasks
=====

Your Learning Journals had you authenticate using your GitHub username.
Let's have the imager app do the same.
Fulfill these user stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to log into the imager app with my GitHub account.
* As a user, I want to be able to register and log in with a username/password combination if I don't have a GitHub account.
* As a user, I want the way to log in with my GitHub account to be obvious

Stretch Stories (2 pts each)
----------------------------

* As a user, I want to be able to use my Google account for authentication.
* ... Twitter account ...
* ... Facebook account ...
* ... LinkedIn account ...
* ... Instagram account ...
* ... Pinterest account ...
