Twitter has become a very effective way for connecting with the developer community.

Tasks
=====

* If you don't already have a Twitter account, set one up.
* Add a nice or interesting photo of your lovely face
* Practice "mentioning" another user. Not sure what to say? Try tweeting something about Code Fellows, using the CF handle: @codefellows
* Follow @codefellows, @nhuntwalker (with caution), @crisewing, & your classmates. Twitter will then suggest a number of other interesting accounts.
* You may want to start following influential programmers, Python-focused accounts, and other tech-aware accounts as well. Here's a few to start:
    * `@gvanrossum <https://twitter.com/gvanrossum>`_
    * `@realpython <https://twitter.com/realpython>`_
    * `@SEA_TechEvents <https://twitter.com/SEA_TechEvents>`_
    * `@PythonHub <https://twitter.com/PythonHub>`_
    * `@ThePracticalDev <https://twitter.com/ThePracticalDev>`_ 
    * `@ps_python <https://twitter.com/ps_python>`_
    * `@pybites <https://twitter.com/pybites>`_
    * `@PythonStack <https://twitter.com/PythonStack>`_
    * `@fullstackpython <https://twitter.com/fullstackpython>`_
