Tasks
=====

Each day, you will report on:

- What you worked on
- Who you worked with
- What tests you wrote

**For what you worked on**, talk about what feature or aspect of the application you spent the majority of your time on.
If you worked on a variety of things, leave a brief description of each.

**For who you worked with**, talk about which of the other group members you worked with that day, and on what features of the application you worked on them with.

**For what tests you wrote**, talk about...the tests that you wrote.
Even if they don't make it into the final product, **give a brief description of 5 tests that you personally wrote.**
You must write at least 5 tests each day to get full credit for this assignment.
If you wrote more than 5, just talk about 5 that you wrote. They will be 0.5 points each.
