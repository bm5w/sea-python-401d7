Django: Add Pagination for Imager
*********************************

We've seen how to add pagination to a Django app using our User Profiles.
Those, however, aren't typically things that we want to see pages of.
Let's put the spotlight on things we care most about!

Here is `the documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/pagination/>`_ for Django's built-in pagination.
Do your work on a branch called ``pagination``.

Tasks
=====

Add pagination to your Imager app that fulfills these user stories:

* As a user, I should see no more than 4 Photos or 4 Albums at a time on my Library page.
* As a user, I should be able to interact with the Library page to see more Photos or more Albums if they exist.
* As a user, I should also be able to see previous pages of Photos or Albums if they exist.
* As a user, I should see no more than 4 Photos on any Album page.
* As a user, I should be able to interact with any Album to see more Photos if they exist.
* As a user, I should be able to see previous Photos in an Album if they exist.
* As a user, I don't want to be prompted to see more Photos or Albums if none are left to be seen.

**Stretch**:

As a user, I want to choose the number of Photos or Albums I see.
It should default to 4, but be variable from the client side.
