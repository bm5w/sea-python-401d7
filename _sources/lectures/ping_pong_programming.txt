===================================
Ping Pong Pair Programming Workflow
===================================

To date, most Pair Programming that you all have one has been of the **Driver-Navigator** form.
The **driver** sits at the keyboard and types the code that the **navigator** dictates should be typed.
This is all well and good, but often leads to a lot of idleness for half the team.
In this class, most assignments from this point forward will be Pair Programming assignments, and I want you all to get the most out of it, so we'll be putting a different spin on it.
We'll be Ping Pong Pair Programming.

With Ping Pong Pair Programming, the roles are somewhat different.
Instead of a Driver-Navigator split, the team is now a **Tester-Coder** split, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
In this way, each one of the pair gets experience writing tests and each one of the pair gets experience writing code that makes the app run.
Here's how it will work moving forward.

Ping-Ponging for Two
====================

Consider the following scenario.
Selena and I are working together on the `Mathematical Series </assignments/math_series.rst>`_ assignment.
We've decided to work on my code first, so I make my repository with License, .gitignore, and README.
Then we both clone it down to our local machines.
I start a new branch called ``fibonacci``.
Finally, I create empty files for ``series.py`` and ``test_series.py``, building out the basic scaffolding for my work.
I then add these files to my local repository, push them to GitHub, and Selena clones those files down.

It's my code so I'm trying to navigate, dictating to Selena what code I want written.
However, instead of just dictating what I want, **I start by writing a test for my code** while she looks on.
One test that of course fails.
I add, commit, and push this code to GitHub on my ``fibonacci`` branch.
Selena fetches the new branch and pulls it to her local machine, where she writes the code that makes the test pass while I look on.
Once the test is passing, if the code needs to be refactored, Selena refactors while I look on.
After, she adds, commits, and pushes this code to GitHub on the same branch.
I pull the updated branch back down and write my next test.

We continue going back and forth like this until the ``fibonacci`` feature is done.
When it is done, we switch and work on her code, with me as **Coder** and Selena as **Tester**.

We go back and forth for ***every feature***, where my feature gets completed and then hers gets completed.

Once the code is ready for submission, the commit history on *my code* should look like:

* nhuntwalker: started the repository
* nhuntwalker: wrote test for fibonacci returning "2" for n=3
* SeleniumK: created the fibonacci function satisfying the n=3 test
* nhuntwalker: wrote test for fibonacci at n=10
* SeleniumK: fibonacci function now satisfies the n=10 test
* nhuntwalker: created pytest value table and a test for large numbers
* SeleniumK: modified and refactored fibonacci function to past tests for any N

And so on.

Ping-Ponging for Three
======================

In a three-person group it's a little bit of a different situation.
The person whose code is being worked on serves on a more classical Navigator role.
Their partners then take on the Tester and Coder roles.
As the Navigator, they dictate the test to be written and the code that gets written to pass the test.
In practice, it looks like the following:

I'm triple-programming with Selena and Norton on my codebase.
I create the repository, with License, README, and a proper ``.gitignore``.
I also push up the basic scaffolding for my code.
Norton and Selena both pull it down, with Norton as my Tester and Selena as my coder.
They work as in Ping-Ponging for two, while I act as Navigator and dictate which tests get written and which code gets written to pass the test.

When the feature in my codebase is written, we rotate.

Follow these guidelines in the coming weeks and, as always, please come if you have questions about how this workflow should progress.
