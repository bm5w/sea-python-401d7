Python Web Frameworks in the Wild
=====================================

Source: `Python Web Frameworks <https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks>`_


Frameworks We Teach
===================

We will be installing and using the following two web frameworks because without them, we'd have to do a lot of stuff ourselves that we may not want to do (or may not be able to do well).
Frameworks give you a set of tools to deal with incoming requests, return responses to those requests, interact with a database, create programmable templates for creating web front-ends, etc.

`Pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_
------------------------------------

Pyramid makes it extremely easy to write web applications, whether small or large.
Unlike larger frameworks, Pyramid makes fewer decisions for you and demands less of you.
Unlike smaller frameworks such  as Flask, Pyramid allows your app to grow when it needs to, without complicated refactoring.
Pyramid focuses on producing a simple, finished product regardless of the size.

`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_
------------------------------------------

Django is unarguably the most popular Python Web framework.
It encourages rapid development and clean design.
Django has more moving parts than Pyramid, and a steeper learning curve.
But the large ecosystem of add-ons that have been created (see `django packages <https://www.djangopackages.com/>`_) means that Django is also more easily customized.
You can use Django to make a full site if you want, or to encapsulate some smaller piece of functionality that you want to use across multiple projects.

The Wider World of Python Frameworks
====================================

There are many other Python web frameworks, scores, in fact.
If you're interested in a survey, you can get `this free pamphlet <http://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/free/python-web-frameworks.csp>`_ from O'Reilly to learn about the most downloaded of the current crop.
Here are some other Python Frameworks and some notable sites built either entirely by or using parts of those frameworks.
